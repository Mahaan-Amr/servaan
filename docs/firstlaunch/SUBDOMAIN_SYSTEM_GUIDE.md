## 🔧 **✅ Technical Implementation - COMPLETED WITH ENHANCED CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT**

### **✅ How Subdomains Work with ENHANCED CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT:**

#### **1. DNS Configuration (TO BE SET UP)**
```
DNS Records:
├── servaan.ir          → Main marketing website
├── *.servaan.ir        → Wildcard points to your application
├── cafe-golestan.servaan.ir/workspaces/customer-relationship-management/customers → Enhanced Customer List
├── cafe-golestan.servaan.ir/workspaces/customer-relationship-management/analytics/advanced → Advanced Analytics Dashboard
└── restaurant-pardis.servaan.ir/workspaces/customer-relationship-management/customers → Separate Enhanced Customer List
```

#### **2. ✅ Request Routing with ENHANCED CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT (IMPLEMENTED)**
```typescript
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED: When user visits cafe-golestan.servaan.ir/workspaces/customer-relationship-management/customers
1. Browser sends request to server
2. Server extracts "cafe-golestan" from subdomain using extractSubdomain()
3. Server looks up tenant with subdomain "cafe-golestan"
4. Enhanced Customer API calls filtered by tenantId for complete data isolation
5. User sees their business customer list only
6. List shows data specific to cafe-golestan
```

#### **3. ✅ ENHANCED CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT Data Isolation (IMPLEMENTED)**
```typescript
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Loading customer list for specific tenant
// Customer List API - tenant-filtered
const customerList = await customerService.getCustomerList({ 
  tenantId: tenant.id,
  filter: selectedFilter 
});

// Result: Each subdomain shows completely different customer list data
// cafe-golestan.servaan.ir → Shows only cafe-golestan's customer list
// restaurant-pardis.servaan.ir → Shows only restaurant-pardis's customer list
```

#### **4. ✅ Tenant Middleware Implementation**
```typescript
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED: src/backend/src/middlewares/tenantMiddleware.ts

export const resolveTenant = async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const host = req.get('host') || '';
  const subdomain = extractSubdomain(host);
  
  if (!subdomain) {
    return next(); // No subdomain, continue (for main domain)
  }
  
  const tenant = await prisma.tenant.findUnique({
    where: { subdomain },
    include: { features: true }
  });
  
  if (!tenant) {
    return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Tenant not found' });
  }
  
  if (!tenant.isActive) {
    return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Tenant suspended' });
  }
  
  req.tenant = {
    id: tenant.id,
    subdomain: tenant.subdomain,
    name: tenant.name,
    plan: tenant.plan,
    isActive: tenant.isActive,
    features: tenant.features
  };
  
  next();
};

function extractSubdomain(host: string): string | null {
  if (host.includes('localhost') || host.includes('127.0.0.1')) {
    return 'default'; // Development mode
  }
  
  const parts = host.split('.');
  if (parts.length >= 3) {
    return parts[0]; // Extract subdomain
  }
  
  return null;
}
```

#### **5. ✅ SMS Integration with Subdomains (IMPLEMENTED & OPERATIONAL)**
```typescript
// ✅ IMPLEMENTED: SMS messages include correct subdomain links
await smsService.sendBusinessInvitation({
  phoneNumber: '09051305165',
  recipientName: 'علی احمدی',
  businessName: 'کافه گلستان', // Matches subdomain context
  inviterName: 'احمد رضایی',
  inviteCode: 'کاف-8887',
  subdomain: 'cafe-golestan' // Ensures correct link in SMS
});

// SMS Template includes: "Visit cafe-golestan.servaan.ir/customers to manage"
// ✅ DELIVERED TO REAL USER PHONE: 09051305165 ⭐ VERIFIED
