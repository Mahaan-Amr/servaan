## Customer Health Scoring

### Overview

The Customer Health Scoring system provides real-time assessment of customer engagement, risk factors, and lifetime value potential through a sophisticated scoring algorithm that analyzes multiple data dimensions.

### Key Features

#### 1. Health Score Components
- **Visit Frequency** (Weight: 25%): Regularity and consistency of visits
- **Spending Behavior** (Weight: 20%): Purchase patterns and value trends
- **Loyalty Engagement** (Weight: 15%): Participation in loyalty programs
- **Feedback Sentiment** (Weight: 15%): Customer satisfaction metrics
- **Communication Response** (Weight: 15%): Engagement with marketing efforts
- **Recency Factor** (Weight: 10%): Time since last interaction

#### 2. Risk Assessment
- **Churn Risk**: Probability of customer leaving with mitigation strategies
- **Engagement Risk**: Risk of reduced participation and interaction
- **Value Risk**: Potential for decreased spending and loyalty

#### 3. Engagement Analysis
- **Overall Engagement Level**: LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, EXCEPTIONAL
- **Channel Engagement**: Performance across different communication channels
- **Campaign Engagement**: Response rates and interaction metrics
- **Loyalty Engagement**: Points earning/redemption and tier progression

#### 4. Prediction Models
- **Next Visit Prediction**: When customer is likely to return
- **Spending Predictions**: Expected amounts for future interactions
- **Lifetime Value Prediction**: Projected total customer value
- **Churn Prevention**: Actionable steps to prevent customer loss

#### 5. Health History
- **Score Tracking**: Historical health score progression
- **Significant Changes**: Detection of major shifts in customer behavior
- **Alert System**: Critical notifications for immediate action

#### 6. Health Insights
- **Critical Alerts**: Urgent issues requiring immediate attention
- **Opportunities**: Growth and engagement potential identification
- **Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for improvement

### Scoring Algorithm

The health score is calculated using a weighted average of six key components:

```
Health Score = (
  Visit Frequency × 25% +
  Spending Behavior × 20% +
  Loyalty Engagement × 15% +
  Feedback Sentiment × 15% +
  Communication Response × 15% +
  Recency Factor × 10%
)
```

### Health Levels

- **EXCELLENT (80-100)**: Highly engaged, loyal customers
- **GOOD (60-79)**: Solid customers with growth potential
- **FAIR (40-59)**: At-risk customers needing attention
- **POOR (0-39)**: Critical customers requiring immediate intervention

## Usage Examples

### Accessing Enhanced Customer Profile

```typescript
import { getEnhancedCustomerProfile } from './services/enhancedCustomerProfileService';

// Get complete profile
const profile = await getEnhancedCustomerProfile(customerId);

// Access specific insights
const nextActions = profile.personalizedInsights.nextBestActions;
const strengthLevel = profile.relationshipStrength.strengthLevel;
const favoriteItems = profile.purchaseHistoryAnalysis.favoriteItems;
```

### Working with Health Scores

```typescript
import { getCustomerHealthScore } from './services/customerHealthScoringService';

// Get health score
const healthData = await getCustomerHealthScore(customerId);

// Check health level
if (healthData.healthLevel === 'POOR') {
  // Trigger immediate intervention
  const alerts = healthData.insights.criticalAlerts;
  // Process alerts...
}

// Analyze risk factors
const churnRisk = healthData.riskAssessment.churnRisk;
if (churnRisk.riskLevel === 'HIGH') {
  // Implement retention strategies
  const strategies = churnRisk.mitigationStrategies;
  // Execute strategies...
}
```

### Batch Operations

```typescript
// Process multiple customers
const customerIds = ['customer1', 'customer2', 'customer3'];
const profiles = await getBatchEnhancedProfiles(customerIds);
const healthScores = await getBatchHealthScores(customerIds);

// Analyze segment performance
const segmentAnalysis = profiles.reduce((acc, profile) => {
  const segment = profile.customer.segment;
  acc[segment] = acc[segment] || [];
  acc[segment].push(profile);
  return acc;
}, {});
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy

- **Profile Data**: Cached for 1 hour (configurable)
- **Health Scores**: Calculated daily, cached until next calculation
- **Insights**: Refreshed on significant data changes
- **Batch Operations**: Processed in chunks of 50 customers

### Database Optimization

- Indexed fields for fast lookups
- Materialized views for complex calculations
- Background jobs for score calculations
- Efficient query patterns for large datasets

### Frontend Performance

- Lazy loading of dashboard components
- Progressive data loading for large profiles
- Optimized re-renders with React.memo
- Virtualization for large datasets

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Key Metrics

- Profile completeness distribution
- Health score trends across segments
- Alert response times
- Feature usage analytics
- API performance metrics

### Dashboard Integration

The system integrates with existing analytics dashboards to provide:
- Customer segment health overview
- Risk distribution analysis
- Engagement trend monitoring
- ROI measurement for interventions

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Customer data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance for EU customers
- Data retention policies
- Audit logging for data access

### Access Control

- Role-based access to customer insights
- API authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Sensitive data masking in logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Profile Data Not Loading
```
Error: Enhanced profile data unavailable
Solution: Check data freshness and cache status
```

#### 2. Health Score Calculation Errors
```
Error: Insufficient data for health score calculation
Solution: Ensure minimum data requirements are met
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```
Issue: Slow dashboard loading
Solution: Enable component lazy loading and check network
```

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed troubleshooting:

```typescript
const debugConfig = {
  logLevel: 'debug',
  includeApiCalls: true,
  showDataSources: true,
  trackPerformance: true
};
```
