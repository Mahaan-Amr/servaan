# 🔒 Admin Panel Security Policy

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS**

The Servaan Platform Admin Panel handles **sensitive platform-level operations** and must maintain the **highest security standards**. This document outlines all security measures, policies, and procedures.

## 🎯 Security Objectives

### **Primary Goals**
- **Data Protection**: Ensure tenant data isolation and security
- **Access Control**: Restrict admin panel access to authorized personnel only
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all admin actions
- **Compliance**: Meet industry security standards and regulations
- **Incident Response**: Rapid detection and response to security threats

### **Security Principles**
- **Zero Trust**: Never trust, always verify
- **Least Privilege**: Grant minimum necessary access
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security oversight
- **Regular Audits**: Periodic security assessments
