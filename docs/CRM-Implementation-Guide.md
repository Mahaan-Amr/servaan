- **CRM**: Integrated CRM workspace for customer management
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Payment Gateway**: Integration with Zarinpal for online payments
- **SMS Provider**: Integration with Kavenegar for sending SMS messages
- **File Storage**: Local file storage for uploaded images and documents
- **Caching**: Redis for caching frequently accessed data
- **Logging**: Winston for logging application events
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring system metrics
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment

## Data Flow

1. User interacts with the frontend application
2. Frontend sends API requests to the backend
3. Backend processes the requests, interacts with the database, and sends responses
4. CRM workspace handles customer management tasks
5. SMS messages are sent using the SMS provider
6. Online payments are processed using the payment gateway
7. Uploaded files are stored in the file storage system
8. Cached data is retrieved from Redis for faster access
9. Application events are logged using Winston
10. System metrics are monitored using Prometheus and Grafana
11. Continuous integration and deployment are handled by GitHub Actions

## Deployment

- **Development**: Local development environment with Docker Compose
- **Staging**: Automated deployment to a staging environment using GitHub Actions
- **Production**: Manual deployment to the production environment using Ansible
