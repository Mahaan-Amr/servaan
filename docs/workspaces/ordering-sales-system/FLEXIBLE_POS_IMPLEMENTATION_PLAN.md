# 🚀 Flexible POS System Implementation Plan

## 📋 **Overview**

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to enhance the POS system with flexible payment options, order modifications, and real-time order management capabilities.

## 🎯 **Current Issues & Solutions**

### **❌ Current Problems:**

2. **No Order Editing** - Can't modify orders after submission
3. **No Partial Payments** - Can't handle multiple payment sessions
4. **No Order Additions** - Can't add items to existing orders
5. **No Payment Tracking** - No way to track paid vs unpaid amounts

### **✅ Proposed Solutions:**
1. **Flexible Payment Types** - IMMEDIATE, PAY_AFTER_SERVICE, PARTIAL
2. **Order Modification System** - Track all order changes
3. **Payment Tracking** - Real-time payment status and remaining amounts
4. **Order Enhancement** - Add items, modify existing items, split bills
5. **Real-time Updates** - Live order status and payment updates
